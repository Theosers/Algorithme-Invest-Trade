### General Info

Designing an algorithm that will maximize the profit achieved by clients after two years of investment. The algorithm was required to provide a list of the most profitable stocks that the company should purchase to maximize a client's profit within a two-year timeframe.

-    Development of a brute-force algorithm.
-    Development of a recursive knapsack-type algorithm using matrices.
-    Preparation of a flowchart describing the thought process underlying the optimized solution and the algorithm's limitations (edge cases).
-    Creation of a diagram comparing the efficiency and performance of the optimized algorithm to the brute-force algorithm using Big-O notation, time complexity, and memory analysis.

## How to use this repository

For each Python file, a different algorithm. To execute the algorithm, simply write the function in an interpreter, specifying the bank account's capacity and the list of items to process.
